# Magic

**âœ¨ Magic** is a tool for managing command line scripts.

## Usage

**Magic** can be used to simplify often repeated tasks such as starting servers and deploying applications.

Scripts can be registered from commands or **Makefiles**, which are linked into a JSON format file called the **Spellbook** (`Spellbook.json`). Working directory is registered as well.

Each spell is given a **message** and one or several **magic words** (identifiers) used to call it.
